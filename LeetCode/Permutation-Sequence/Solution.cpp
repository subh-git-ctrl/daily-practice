arr
[ 1            2           3          4]
1 2 3 4     2 1 3 4     3 1 2 4    4 1 2 3
1 2 4 3     2 1 4 3     3 1 4 2    4 1 3 2
1 3 2 4     2 3 1 4     3 2 1 4    4 2 1 3
1 3 4 2     2 3 4 1     3 2 4 1    4 2 3 1
1 4 2 3     2 4 1 3     3 4 1 2    4 3 1 2
1 4 3 2     2 4 3 1     3 4 2 1    4 3 2 1
So we have 4 block with 6 elements each.

n = 4  we can take an array [1,2,3,4] , initital ans = ""
lets say we have k =15, the 15 th permutation is "3 2 1 4":

As we can see the first value is 3 that means out of the four blocks we need the 3rd block. 
Each blocks has n-1! = 3! = 6 elements --> 15 = 6*2 + 3 i.e. we skip 2 blocks and our ans is the third element in the 3rd block
Let us assume the blocks are zero indexed.
Now 15 / 6 = 2;  So we select the 2nd block (0-indexed) that means 2nd index in our array - 3
Now ans = "3"
Remove this element from the array and our array becomes: [1,2,4]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now we are in this block:
3 1 2 4  - 1  
3 1 4 2  - 2   Block 0
  ------ 
3 2 1 4  - 3 (ans)
3 2 4 1  - 4    Block 1
  ------
3 4 1 2  - 5   
3 4 2 1  - 6    Block 2
Now we have 3 blocks each of with 2 elements 
i,e. n = n-1 = 3blocks and n-1! = 2! = 2 elements
n = 3, what will be the k? As we passed 12 elements we have k = 15-12 => the third element in this large block.
k = 3
element in partition (p) = 2;
k / p = 3 / 2 = 1 => ans is in block 1, value to add to ans  = 2
arr[1] = 2;
ans = "32"
remove 2 from array => [1,4]
Now we have 2 elements left(n-1 = 3-1) 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
32  1 4  Block 0
32  4 1  Block 1

n=2, k = 1
1 will be added ans = "321"  arr= [4]
As we only have one value value in array append it to ans.  ans = "3214"

One very important note:(Corner case)
When we have k as a multiple of elements in partition for e.g. k = 12 Then we want to be in block with index 1
but as index = 12 / 6 = 2; we have to keep index = index-1;
Only when we are aiming at the last element we will hit this case.
Here the blocks are zero indexed but the elements inside them are 1 index.

I'm sure after you look at the code you will completely understand it
